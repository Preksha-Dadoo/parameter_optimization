# Parameter_optimization

 It helps in finding the best set of parameters (or hyperparameters) for a machine learning model to maximize its performance. 

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Load the Wine dataset from UCI.
- Divide the dataset into 70-30 training and testing splits.
- Perform SVM optimization for 10 different samples using Grid Search.
- Plot the convergence graph of the model's accuracy across iterations.
